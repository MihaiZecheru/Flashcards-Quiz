Flashcards Quiz
-------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains 3 executable (`.exe`) files.

The source files for this project are located in `/src/`.
Feel free to look through to see how the applications were made.

Double click the files ending in `.exe` to use them. These `.exe` files are listed below.

Executables
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 executable files:
- `Quiz.exe`: requires a pre-existing `.qfc` file. These files are made by running `Make Flashcard Set.exe`.
- `Make Flashcard Set.exe`: create a `.qfc` (flashcards) file to quiz yourself with. `*.qfc` be sent to others.
- `_decode_qfc.exe`: decode a `.qfc` file, displaying the contents. Can only be run from the terminal or ignored.

Note
-------------------------------------------------------------

`.qfc` is a file extension made specifically for this project. It's simply an encoded `.txt` file.

You can download this project's release [here](https://github.com/MihaiZecheru/Flashcards-Quiz/releases/download/FlashcardsQuiz/cpp_quiz.zip).

For my pleasure, send me the flashcard sets (`.qfc`) you make at [my email](mihai@mzecheru.com)
